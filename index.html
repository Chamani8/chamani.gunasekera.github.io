Theoretical Astrophysics, Astrophysical Data Analysis and Numerical Simulations. In
particular, understanding the underlying physics (from cosmic chemical evolution to
details of radiative transfer) of hot gaseous environments from optical to X-ray and
improving Cloudy (a spectral synthesis software that simulates conditions in gaseous
nebulae).
